## 🎯 Challenge Track: Vibe Coding for Social Impact
A Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Mental Health - combining AI therapy, Web3 privacy, community governance, and blockchain-verified wellness tracking.
## 🌟 Project Overview
3Therapy is a revolutionary decentralized platform that reimagines mental health support through blockchain technology, AI assistance, and community governance. We're building the first Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) for Mental Wellness.
## 🚀 What Makes This Special:
- 🏛️ DAO Governance: Community members vote on platform improvements, resource allocation, and crisis response protocols using wellness tokens
- 🤖 AI-Powered Therapy: Advanced conversational AI provides 24/7 mental health support with context-aware, empathetic responses
- 🔒 Privacy-First Web3: Anonymous blockchain identities, zero-knowledge participation proofs, and user-controlled data ownership
- 💎 Wellness Token Economy: Earn tokens for participation, helping others, and achieving mental health milestones - creating sustainable incentives for community support
- 🏆 Achievement NFTs: Permanent, verifiable records of mental health journey milestones that users own and control
- 📊 Community Impact Metrics: Transparent, aggregated progress tracking that shows collective healing without compromising individual privacy
